# PHP Api Test

Sam has written a small e-commerce site during a hackathon

You have been hired as a developer to rewrite the application so that it can be used in production

The system needs to be able to perform the following:

1. User index endpoint
  - /users
  - The endpoint needs to:
    - Accept a param ?query=Product A which allows the filter of users based on the products they purchased or their name
    - Accept a param ?sortBy=purchase:asc which allows the sorting of users based on the purchase amount (in either ascending or descending format)
2. User details endpoint
  - /users/{id}
  - The endpoint needs to show the user information, which include:
    - User information
    - The number of each products they purchased, sorted by descending order
    - The purchase amount they have done grouped by months
3. User orders endpoint
  - /users/{id}/orders
  - The endpoint need to show the orders that has been created by the user

The current relationship is as follows:
- User: The user of the system
- Product: The product that can be purchased
- Order: The order that has been created, each order only contain 1 product
